        <p>Some early treatises—such as those of Cicero on the pleasantness of old age or on the art of “divination,” Seneca on anger or clemency, and Plutarch on the passing of oracles—presage to a certain degree the form and tone of the essay, but not until the late 16th century was the flexible and deliberately nonchalant and versatile form of the essay perfected by the French writer Michel de Montaigne. Choosing the name essai to emphasize that his compositions were attempts or endeavours, a groping toward the expression of his personal thoughts and experiences, Montaigne used the essay as a means of self-discovery. His Essais, published in their final form in 1588, are still considered among the finest of their kind. Later writers who most nearly recall the charm of Montaigne include, in England, Robert Burton, though his whimsicality is more erudite, Sir Thomas Browne, and Laurence Sterne, and in France, with more self-consciousness and pose, André Gide and Jean Cocteau.</p>

    <p><h3>After World War II, Berlin’s interest shifted from his early preoccupation with Analytic philosophy to the fields of political science, political theory, and intellectual history. His first important book was Karl Marx; His Life and Environment (1939; rev. ed. 1959, 1963), an intellectual biography of Marx that was highly praised for its objectivity. Among his other noted works are Historical Inevitability (1955), which stands as a major critique of the doctrines of determinism; The Age of Enlightenment (1956), a discussion of 18th-century philosophers; and Four Essays on Liberty (1969). Berlin’s political philosophy is generally concerned with the problem of liberty and free will in increasingly totalitarian and mechanistic societies. Perhaps his most influential book, however, was The Hedgehog and the Fox (1953), in which he divides the world’s thinkers into those (the foxes) who, like Aristotle and Shakespeare, “knew many things,” and those (the hedgehogs) who, like Plato and Dante, “knew one big thing.” Berlin’s essays on various topics were collected in Russian Thinkers (1978), Concepts and Categories (1978), Against the Current (1979), and Personal Impressions (1980). Among his other works are Vico and Herder: Two Studies in the History of Ideas (1976), The Crooked Timber of Humanity: Chapters in the History of Ideas (1990), and The Magus of the North: J.G. Hamann and the Origins of Modern Irrationalism (1993).</h3></p>
